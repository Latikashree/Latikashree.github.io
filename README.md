### Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

### Project Overview
---

Welcome, to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a dynamic bike-share company in Chicago, my journey aimed to address crucial business questions with the primary objective of maximizing annual memberships. Under the guidance of Moreno, our goal is to design marketing strategies that convert casual riders into dedicated Cyclistic members. The challenge lies in unraveling the nuances between annual members and casual riders, understanding why casual riders would opt for a membership. 

To meet this challenge, I adopted a systematic data analysis process, progressing through the stages of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Employing various data analysis tools, I began with Microsoft Excel, navigating through initial data exploration and preparation stages. Subsequently, the data underwent transition into SQL, a robust tool for cleansing and analysis. This methodical process culminated in the final phase, where I utilized Tableau to create comprehensive visualizations.

Each step of this process was aimed at analyzing trends within Cyclistic's historical bike trip data, forming the foundation for informed marketing strategies and data-driven decision-making. This case study showcases not only the technical aspects of data analysis but also the strategic thinking and insights crucial for addressing business challenges.
