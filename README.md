# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

### Project Overview
---

Welcome, to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a dynamic bike-share company in Chicago, my journey aimed to address crucial business questions with the primary objective of maximizing annual memberships. Under the guidance of Moreno, our goal is to design marketing strategies that convert casual riders into dedicated Cyclistic members. The challenge lies in unraveling the nuances between annual members and casual riders, understanding why casual riders would opt for a membership. 

To meet this challenge, I adopted a systematic data analysis process, progressing through the stages of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Employing various data analysis tools, I began with Microsoft Excel, navigating through initial data exploration and preparation stages. Subsequently, the data underwent transition into SQL, a powerful tool for cleansing and analysis. This methodical process culminated in the final phase, where I utilized Tableau to create comprehensive visualizations.

Each step of this process was aimed at analyzing trends within Cyclistic's historical bike trip data, forming the foundation for informed marketing strategies and data-driven decision-making. This case study showcases not only the technical aspects of data analysis but also the strategic thinking and insights crucial for addressing business challenges.

### About The Company
---

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### ASK
---
In the Ask phase of the Cyclistic bike-share analysis, the focus is on addressing key questions to guide the future marketing program. Cyclistic's finance analysts have already concluded that annual memberships yield higher profitability than single-ride and day-passes, also the marketing director Lily Moreno's vision is to convert casual riders into annual members for sustainable company growth.

#### TASK 
The objective assigned by Marketing Director Lily Moreno is to understand how casual users and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. Key questions guiding this data analysis include:
- What are the preferred bicycle types for annual members and casual users?
- How do starting and ending stations differ between annual members and casual users?
- Which stations are the most frequented by all riders?
- What are the commonly used routes for annual members and casual users?
- At what times do riders prefer to use Cyclistic bikes, considering various time metrics?
- How does the duration of trips compare between annual members and casual users?
